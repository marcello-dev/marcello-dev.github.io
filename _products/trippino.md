[Trippino](https://trippino.apivenue.com) is a simple trip planner web app. 

It is designed to work onffline as much as possible, this is because when travelling internet connection is not always with us. 

You can plan which city to visit, how many nights to stay, and add notes for anything you want. It also shows the itinerary on a map and a calendar.
