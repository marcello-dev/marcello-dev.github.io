Hi! My name is Marcello Monachesi, but you can call me **Marc**. I am a software engineer with 4+ years experience.  
I received my Master's Cum Laude in Computer Engineering from the University of Bologna (Italy) in 2015. Then I worked 4 years at Fraunhofer FOKUS, the biggest institute for applied research in Germany. Currently, I live in Taipei with my girlfriend and moving to a new working experience.
