title:  "Launching Trippino"

[Trippino](https://trippino.apivenue.com) is my latest personal project, inspired by Stippl I wanted to make something similar and open-source!

The name "Trippino" is the combination of "trip" + "ino", "ino" means little in Italian, so "little trip" lol. 

It is built as a single NodeJS app, with static pages and a few REST APIs. Very lightweight. No frontend frameworks, only CSS, HTML and Javascript. Copilot helped a lot with the frontend, don't judge me plz.

It is designed to work onffline as much as possible, this is because when travelling internet connection is not always with us. 

But what can it do? It stores trip information like which city to visit, how many nights to stay, and notes to add anything you want. It also shows the itinerary on a map and calendar.

There are more features coming for later, storing files offline for bookings and tickets, transportation between cities, a better map, etc..

The project is fully opensource, if you tried it and enjoyed it, leave a star on Github :)
