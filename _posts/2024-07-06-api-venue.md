title:  "Launching API Venue"

[API Venue](https://apivenue.com) is my latest personal project, designed to offer REST APIs for various use cases. The goal is to provide affordable, low-latency, and high-quality APIs.

One of the biggest marketplace for APIs is [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com), where developer can publish their APIs and anyone can use them for free or with a subscription plan. The average cost of an API seems to be around $25 per month. So I thought, "There must be a way to offer high-quality APIs at a more affordable price."

As of today, all [APIs offered by API Venue](https://rapidapi.com/user/epsi) are either free or more affordable than the average API on RapidAPI, while still providing very low latency globally. 

These are some of the APIs available now: 
- **Airports**: provides airport data, including ICAO/IATA codes and local time
- **Football**: provides football fixtures, live scores, teams, and players (check out the [demo](https://apivenue.com/football/demo))
- **Country Codes**: provides country and subdivision ISO codes
- **QR Code**: for creating QR Codes in different ways
- **EZ Twitter X**: for fetching Twitter/X data including users and tweets

**Airport API** and **Football API** seem to be already very popular with a score of more than 9!

Achieving good performance at low cost has been challenging, because in general, the more the performance the more the cost. I will share more details about these challenges and solutions in future posts.

The list of APIs will grow over time, depending on how much time I can dedicate to it. For now, thank you for reading, and have a nice day.
